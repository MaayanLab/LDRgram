Imaging assay - monitoring dose response of anti-mitotic compounds in human cancer cell lines at 24, 48, and 72 hours to determine their effects on apoptosis.  To score viability and apoptosis, a dye-based imaging assay was used; the cell-permeable DNA dye Hoechst 33342 was used to mark nuclei and DEVD-NucView488 caspase-3 substrate was used to mark apoptosis (stains nuclei of cells undergoing apoptosis, in which caspase 3 is active).

Imaging assay - monitoring dose response of anti-mitotic compounds in human cancer cell lines at 72 to 96 hours to determine their effects on apoptosis.  To score viability and apoptosis, a dye-based imaging assay will be used; the cell-permeable DNA dye Hoechst 33342 is used to mark nuclei and DEVD-NucView488 caspase-3 substrate is used to mark apoptosis (stains nuclei of cells undergoing apoptosis, in which caspase 3 is active).

To generate measures of the sensitivities of two cell lines to LINCS Phase I Common Cell Line Project kinase inhibitors we treated cells with single drugs at multiple concentrations. After 3 days of incubation, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and nuclei were counted. Cell numbers after drug exposure were compared with numbers present on Day 0, immediately after drug was added. Calculated metrics (IC50, GI50, EC50, Hill coefficient and Einf) from these data are available in HMS-LINCS dataset 20216.

At the appropriate time point, cells will be incubated with 1 uM propidium iodide and 1 uM calcein AM for 30 min to visualize dead and live cells, respectively.  Five to ten fields of view will then be imaged for each treatment using excitation/emission filters of 535/617 nm and 495/515 nm for propidium iodide and calcein AM, respectively. The number of propidium iodide positive and calcein AM iPSNs will be quantified using Image J over 3 separate experiments.

DES	Baseline RNAseq for control and diseased iPSC lines. Baseline gene expression dataset for QC and pipeline development -- 11 total control iPSC cell lines 3 in triplicate and 1 in duplicate and 28 diseased iPSC, 4 ALS and 4 SMA with replicates and with no additional perturbagen. Determine cell line variability and assay reproducibility. RNAseq QC statistics and expression correlation statistics will guide the development of QC standards and appropriate analysis pipeline.

Annotate open chromatin regions and map transcription factor binding events in regulatory elements genome-wide. Generate chromatin accessibility signatures  for each sample individually by calculating the enrichment of genomic regions relative to a set of control reads from Tn5-treated naked genomic DNA. Detect differential peaks between disease and control state. Generate disease signatures for future systems analysis and integration with other omics by 1) identifying genes mapping near differential peaks and detecting significantly enriched GO terms for these gene lists; 2) performing DNA foo printing, motif scoring and applying regression methods to infer transcription factors responsible for gene expression signatures.
