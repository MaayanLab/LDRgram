Next-generation proteomic data acquisition and analysis strategies to support these activities are being developed in the laboratory of Dr. Michael MacCoss of the University of Washington."}},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd85","approved":true,"datasetName":"Fluorescence Imaging Cell Viability Assay","urls":{"qcDocumentUrl":"http://neurolincs.org/index.php?pageID=6","metadataUrl":"http://neurolincs.org/index.php?pageID=6","dataUrl":"http://neurolincs.org/index.php?pageID=6","pubMedUrl":""},"releaseDates":{"upcoming":"2015-06-30T06:00:00.000Z","level4":"2015-06-30T06:00:00.000Z","level3":"2015-06-30T06:00:00.000Z","level2":"2015-06-30T06:00:00.000Z","level1":"2015-06-30T06:00:00.000Z"},"needsEdit":false,"dateModified":"2015-07-30T20:48:02.466Z","did":"LINCS_NeuroLINCS_IMN_055","metadata":{"tagsKeywords":[],"analysisTools":[],"relevantDisease":[],"organism":[{"_id":"55a95fec00bce706c3cdfbd9","name":"Homo sapiens"}],"manipulatedGene":[],"readouts":[{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd82","datatype":"image","name":"cell fluorescence","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd83","datatype":"image","name":"survival time","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd84","datatype":"image","name":"morphology","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166"}],"perturbagens":[{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd80","name":"spinal muscular atrophy","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"disease"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd81","name":"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"disease"}],"cellLines":[{"_id":"55a95ff200bce706c3cdfd74","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS00iCTR-n2","controlOrDisease":"control","class":"normal","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd75","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS14iCTR-n6","controlOrDisease":"control","class":"spinal muscular atrophy","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd76","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS83iCTR-33n1","controlOrDisease":"control","class":"huntington's disease","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd77","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS25iCTR-18n2","controlOrDisease":"control","class":"huntington's disease","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd78","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS28iALS-n2A","controlOrDisease":"diseased","class":"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd79","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS29iALS-n1N","controlOrDisease":"diseased","class":"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd7a","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS30iALS-n1A","controlOrDisease":"diseased","class":"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd7b","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS52iALS-n6A","controlOrDisease":"diseased","class":"amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd7c","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS32iSMA-n3","controlOrDisease":"diseased","class":"spinal muscular atrophy","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd7d","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS13iSMA-n1","controlOrDisease":"diseased","class":"spinal muscular atrophy","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd7e","tissue":"neuron","name":"83iSMA-n5","controlOrDisease":"diseased","class":"spinal muscular atrophy","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"},{"_id":"55a95ff300bce706c3cdfd7f","tissue":"neuron","name":"CS77iSMA-n5","controlOrDisease":"diseased","class":"spinal muscular atrophy","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","type":"iPSCs"}],"assay":[{"_id":"55a95ff200bce706c3cdfd73","name":"iMN toxicity as determined by RM","group":"5519bd94ea7e106fc6784166","abbr":"IMN"}]},"messages":[],"user":"5519bd94ea7e106fc678416a","description":"Imaging assay--monitoring cell survival in control, ALS, and SMA iMNs. iMNs will be transfected with a fluorescence reporter and imaged daily for 10 days.
